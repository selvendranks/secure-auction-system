## Overview

The Secure Auction System with Decentralized Payment is a project that implements a web-based auction platform utilizing blockchain technology, smart contracts, and a hybrid approach for efficient data management. The system allows users to securely list items for auction, place bids, and conduct transparent and trustful auctions.

## Key Features

1. **Auto-Refund Mechanism:** Ensures fairness by automatically refunding bidders who do not win an auction.
2. **Hybrid Data Storage Approach:** Optimizes data storage by combining centralized and decentralized storage for cost-effectiveness.
3. **Independence from Centralized Systems:** The system operates autonomously, providing robustness and security against disruptions in centralized systems.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Firebase
- Truffle
- Ganache
- MetaMask
- Ethereum Blockchain

## Project Structure

- **contracts:** Contains the smart contract code for managing auctions.
- **client:** Houses the frontend React application.
- **test:** Includes test scripts for smart contract testing.
- **config:** Configuration files and scripts for deploying and testing.
